# Quantum Infinite Square Well — Numerical Simulation

This repository contains a Python-based Jupyter Notebook that numerically solves the **1D infinite square well** problem from quantum mechanics using the **finite difference method**.

## 🔬 Features

- Discretizes space using a 1D grid and natural units (ℏ = 1, m = 1)
- Constructs the Hamiltonian matrix using a second-order finite difference approximation
- Solves the time-independent Schrödinger equation via eigenvalue decomposition
- Normalizes wavefunctions and plots the probability densities |ψₙ(x)|²
- Compares numerical solutions to analytical eigenfunctions and energy levels

## 📈 Outputs

- Visualization of the first six numerically computed wavefunctions
- Overlay comparison with true analytical solutions
- Energy spectrum matching theoretical predictions

## 📚 Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Getting Started
